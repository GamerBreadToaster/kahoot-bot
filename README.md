# Kahoot-bot
A simple kahoot bot that uses your chrome browser to infiltrate games

# Working, IMPORTANT!
It is important to read how the program works.

The program opens a REAL tab in your chosen browser, simulates keyboard presses and inputs your chosen name.

The program opens a tab you have chosen in the 'amount of bots' option in the options.txt file.

# Options
These are the allowed options you find in options.txt:

the option 'browsers' controls which browser it will open in. The allowed browsers are for now:

'chrome'

'firefox'

The option 'kahoot code' controls which kahoot code it will go to, example:

719330

The option 'name' will control the name the kahoot bot has.
If the name is for example 'bot', the first bot will be named 'bot' and the second will be named 'bot 2' etc.

the option 'amount of bots' will control how many bots it will send and how many tabs will be opened.
With an free account the max amount of players in a lobby is 10 or 40.
With my testing some of the accounts won't join, so I recommend a couple more.

# Warning!
This kahoot bot uses the chrome browser and simulates keyboard presses. Any interferance by the user will possibly break the program.

I am not responsable for anything this program causes.
